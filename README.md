# Advent-of-code-2023

Hello! My name is Fernando, I am a Spanish programming student who has only been in this fascinating world for just a year. Encouraged by my friend [MichValwin](https://github.com/MichValwin) this year (2023) I have decided to try the Advent of Code more as an introspection exercise for my future programmer than anything else. I hope to enjoy the journey and encourage everyone who wants to try it.

By the way, I use Java because it's almost the only thing I know. Maybe my codes are not short (that's for sure) but I hope to improve over time!

All codes can be checked from the same folder by executing the console command "java name.java" and if you have an input file, it must be included in the same folder. For example:

All codes have been made with **Java 11** unless otherwise indicated.
